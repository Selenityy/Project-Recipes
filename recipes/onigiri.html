        <p><u>Culinary tools you will need:</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rice Cooker</li>
                <li>Onigiri mold <em>optional</em></li>
            </ul>
        <p><u>Steps</u></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take 2 cups of rice and place them in the rice cooker bowl. Make sure to wash the rice a few times to ensure it's clean.</li>
                <li>Dry off the rice cooker bowl and place it back in the cooker itself. Set the rice to Quick Cook.</li>
                <li>Open your can of tuna, and drain the water.</li>
                <li>Mix in a 1:1 ratio of mayo and siracha to the tuna. Stir and taste. Repeat this step as many times as needed until you like the tuna taste.</li>
                <li>Take your seaweed sheets and cut them into equally 1 inch thick strips.</li>
                <li>Lay out the rice seasoning in a line, we wll be rolling the completed onigri through this for the edges to be seasoned.</li>
                <li>Once the rice is cooked, let it cool off a bit as to not burn your hands.</li>
                <li>From here, you'll want to grab a small amount and put it into your onigiri mold <em>or in your wet hands to avoid rice sticking.</em></li>
                <li>Scoop a small amount of your spicy tuna creation and place on top of the rice. Make sure to not overload the rice or it will spill out the sides.</li>
                <li>Grab some more rice and place on top of the tuna.</li>
                <li>If you are using a mold, press down on the rice to make the triangle shape. If you are using your hands, press the rice together and use your fingers to pinch into a triangle shape. <strong>Make sure to really press and pack the rice so it doesn't come apart!</strong></li>
                <li>Take the rice out of the mold and place a seaweed strip centered on the onigiri, wrapping the front and the back.</li>
                <li>Lastly, roll all the edges of the onigiri in rice seasoning.</li>
                <li>Enjoy while it's warm!</li>
