        <p><u>Steps</u></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat a pan on the stove. Make sure to butter the pan prior or use a non-stick spray.</li>
                <li>Take two pieces of bread and <strong>generously</strong> butter one side of each piece.</li>
                <li>Grab your various cheeses and shred them each. I like to mix all the blended cheese together, but that is up to your preference!</li>
                <li>Once the pan is hot enough, take one slice of your bread and place it on the pan, butter side down.</li>
                <li>Next, put as much cheese as you can fit on the bread within the pan.</li>
                <li>Immediately place the other slice of bread on top of the cheese, butter side up.</li>
                <li>Wait a few minutes or until the buttered bread on the pan is a nice toasted color, then carefully flip the bread to toast the other side.</li>
                <li>Wait another few minutes or until the bread is your preferred toasted color, then remove it from the pan. <em>Turn off the stove.</em> </li>
                <li>Lastly, make sure to cut your grilled cheese and take a quick picture of that cheese melting out.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
